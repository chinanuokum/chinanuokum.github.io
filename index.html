            <p>
                My name is Chinanuokum. I'm an intermediate programmer. I know many different languages including:
                HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL. I first began coding in March 2020 on Khan Academy. Since then,
                I've learnt to program from many different sources, school included. In fact, one of the main
                motivations of me doing this is for a good grade. Now you know a bit about me, welcome to my blog! I
                hope it provides you with useful knowledge or simply just entertainment.
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">What is this?</h2>
            <p>
                This is a website I coded as a final project for the HTML/CSS unit on Khan Academy. You can see the what
                it originally looked like in the seciton that says 'First Coding Steps.' This website you're using
                now, is a
                new and (hopefully) improved version of it which I am also doing as a final project. This time, it's for
                my Digital Media course I'm taking at school. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Why is this?</h2>
            <p>
                The premise
                of the Digital Media final project was to take on something that entailed anything Digital Media, whether that be creating a
                website, making a podcast, photoshopping, creating games, etc. I already had a website, but after
                learning all about The Elements and Principles of Design, I realized how ugly the original website was,
                I decided my project would be me updating it.
