        <!-- Intro-->
        <h2 id="intro" class="introC">Introduction to Me</h2>
        <p class="introC"> Hello there, my name is Chinanuokum. I'm a beginner-intermediate programmer on Khan
            Academy. I
            started my first ever piece of coding on... tbh, I don't really remember. I guess I should've written
            that day
            down. Oh well, I enjoy programming. Welcome to my blog :))</p>

        <!-- 1-->
        <h2 id="firstProject" class="firstProjectC">First Project</h2>
        <h6>Posted on some date in March 2020 (I don't remember when exactly).</h6>
        <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-whats-for-dinner/6333793886683136"
            class="firstProjectC"> Check it out here</a>


        <p class="firstProjectC">The first type of programming I learnt was JavaScript. It was actually pretty cool.
            At that
            time, quarantine was happening. I didn't want to feel unproductive, so I was like...why not just learn
            how to
            code. On weekdays, I would watch a video lesson and do a practice lesson. When I finished my first
            project, I
            was proud. It was my first step to becoming a programmer like they always say. I'm glad I decided to
            start
            coding.</p>

            class="learnVarC"> Shooting Star</a>


        <p class="learnVarC">Learning about variabies. Wow, I can hardly remember it. I somewhat recall doing the
            Animal
            Attack and Shooting Star projects. I showed my teacher the Animal Attack Project (something I thought I
            would
            never do in life XD). The Shooting Star project was the first project I worked on during the weekend. I
            was very
            indulged in it, and I guess I had an A HA moment I just NEEDED to fulfil.</p>
        <p class="learnVarC"> Back to variables, I just note that it's helpful so you don't have to adjust every
            line in
            your code to change it.</p>

        <h2 id="adDesign" class="adDesignC"> Ad Design Project</h2>
        <h6> Posted sometime around May 2020</h6>


        <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-ad-design/5572229979848704"
            class="adDesignC"> Le Projet de Ad</a>
        <p class="adDesignC"> Alright, alright. I don't want to be like "yeah yeah, that was the easiest topic to
            learn",
            but it was quite easy. Because the text part of it was easy, I decided to push myself a bit with the
            illustration part. If you click on the link, you can see the quick animation I programmed (I don't know
            if
            animation is the right word); it's two envelopes going <em>swoosh</em>. That was a bit hard to figure
            out how to
            do, especially because it was the first time I used lines (lines to draw the envelope); but I went back
            to what
            I had learnt and did it, because I really wanted to do it. Ha, I guess that's a piece of advice I can
            give you;
            <em id="advice"> good, better, best. I shall never rest. Until my good is better, and my better
                best</em>.
        </p>
        <p class="adDesignC"> Overall, the Project: Ad Design is one of the projects I feel comfortable evaluating
            for
            others. You see, my JavaScript is getting quite rusty. But I hope to brush it up and improve it in
            summer 2021.

        <h2 id="fishTank" class="fishTankC"> Project: Fish Tank</h2>
        <h6> Posted sometime in June 2020</h6>
        <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-fish-tank/6525743102050304"
            class="fishTankC"> Project: Fish Tank</a>


        <p class="fishTankC"> The lessons of this project taught me how to make FUNCTIONS! A very helpful tool. With
            functions, you can draw a shape and make multiple versions of it. Functions are cool. </p>
        <p class="fishTankC"> ^**remember this**^</p>
        <p class="fishTankC"> When I was completing this project, it was the first time I had to balance life
            outside
            quarantine with my usual programming schedule. Because of this, it took me a while to complete the
            project.
            There was another reason why this project took so long. I couldn't figure out how to make the fish
            different
            colours (check out Help Requests on that project). I never really figured it out. BUT as I'm writing
            this, I
            reviewed the project, and I think I got it. I'll do a spin-off of it to check it put. </p>
        <p class="fishTankC"><strong> Another piece of advice I guess: Review your old code. It might challenge your
                thinking and teach you more</strong></p>

        <h2 id="statements" class="statementsC"> Learning If/ Else Statements</h2>


        <h6> Sometime in June 2020</h6>


        <p class="statementsC"> I liked learning about this. It was a bit difficult to fully grasp, but when I
            completed the
            project to it, I understood it. I will say that floor and random and less than and all that was a bit
            difficult
            for me to understand. In all, it taught me how to really do more than drawing. More interactive ish
            things. </p>
        <strong><a
                href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/spin-off-of-project-magic-8-ball/6099789719617536"
                class="statementsC">Check out the link for the project here and play around with the 8
                ball.</a></strong>
        <p class="statementsC">When I was doing the project, I thought it would take me a while, and would be quite
            difficult (because understanding/ learning wasn't easy), but it took me way less amount of time compared
            to
            other projects. That shocked me haha. </p>

        <h2 id="more" class="moreC"> More</h2>


        <p class="moreC"><strong> Loops:</strong> If you're stuck on something, perhaps use the while loop. It might
            help
            you process the code better. Both the for and while loops are very helpful.</p>


        <p class="moreC"><strong> Arrays:</strong> Store lists of values</p>


        <p class="moreC"><strong> Objects:</strong> Store different things in just one variable</p>
